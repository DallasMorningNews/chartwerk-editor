# How chartwerk makes charts

### How data becomes a chart

The following flow chart represents how Chartwerk turns tabular data into a chart. It's important to understand that this process is a little backwards from the perspective of a chart template developer, who builds templates long before a user builds any charts with them and who will not be an active part of this process flow once the template is complete.

#### Steps

1. User supplies tabular data to the Chartwerk editor.
2. User makes selections in the Editor that determine how different features of this chart should be formatted, for example, axes and labels.
3. Chartwerk takes those user selections and any defaults which are part of the chart template
