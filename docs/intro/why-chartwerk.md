### Do we really need _another_ chart maker?

Why, yes! Well, maybe.

Like many chart builders, Chartwerk provides an interface for non-coders to easily create interactive and static charts. However, you may find, like we did, that most chart makers are set-and-forget systems that aren't well designed to grow with the needs of your team.

Chartwerk was designed to be more flexible and a more collaborative tool between coders and non-coders. It lets developers easily build and tweak charts directly alongside non-coding creators. It accomplishes this by exposing a robust internal API that translates tabular data into discrete dataviz properties developers can build chart templates on top of on the fly.

At _The Dallas Morning News_, Chartwerk helps us develop dataviz quickly in response to the needs of beat reporters and scale our development time multiplied by every chart our reporters build from the templates we create.

That said, Chartwerk may not be the best choice among all other chart builders for your team if you don't have at least one developer to help build up your chart template set.
